# Titanic Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers and to understand the demographic distribution aboard the ship.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset includes various features such as passenger class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, fare paid, and survival status. It provides a snapshot of the passengers, which allows for a detailed exploration of the factors influencing survival.

## Methodology
The analysis encompasses data cleaning, feature engineering, and statistical visualizations. Key steps include:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Deriving new features from existing data.
- Visualizing data distributions and correlations between features.
- The Naive Bayes algorithm was used to predict the survival rate, selecting relevant features such as ticket fare, ticket class, gender, and age.

## Results
Key findings from the analysis are highlighted, including:
- The impact of passenger class on survival rates.
- Gender disparities in survival likelihood.
- Age distribution among survivors and non-survivors.

## Tools Used
- Python for data manipulation and analysis.
- Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for documenting the analysis process.

## How to Use
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to view the analysis.
